title: Stop The Zoom Trolls.  Setup Zoom Correctly

Are you thinking about running or are running a public meeting using Zoom?  These are meetings where you intend to post the Zoom link in a place that the general public can see it and anyone can join the meeting.

You might be thinking they won't find your meeting but you would be wrong.  I had a friend that was attending a virtual meetup this past week that had this happen to them and they had to end the meeting right in the middle of an awesome presentation.

It is just a matter of time before a troll joins your meeting with the sole purpose to disrupt your meeting and to make you have to end the meeting early.  The troll will cause disruption by sharing their screen, using the annotation feature to draw on the screen, and talking over the presenter.  They will share porn, write inappropriate messages on the screen and say offensive words.

To minimize the ability of a troll to cause any damage to your meeting there several quick and easy simple actions you need to take in your Zoom settings, when you are scheduling the meeting , and when you are running the meeting.

## Zoom Account Settings

Once your are logged into your Zoom account, go under settings:

* Turn off Join before host

* Turn Off Virtual Background

## Scheduling a meeting

When scheduling a meeting there aren't many options you can art but there are a few important ones.

* When scheduling for the Meeting ID generate it and DON’T use your personal meeting ID
* Don’t Allow Join Before Host
* Mute Participants on Entry
* Set to Auto Record the meeting so that you don’t forget and record to the cloud.

## Running the Meeting

* In the Participants panel, at the start during networking time allow participants to unmute themselves.
* During the presentation, mute all participants and don’t allow them to unmute themselves.  Use the nonverbal feedback so they can signal that they have a question so you can unmute them.  This stops a troll from being able to just randomly unmute themselves.
* In the participants panel, as the host you need to promote all of your other organizers and the prrsenter to co-host so they can share their desktop and moderate the meeting

With these settings in place it is much harder for a troll to disrupt and destroy your meeting.   While at the same time still allowing you to build and grow your  community.

Happy Zooming!
